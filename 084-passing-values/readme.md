<h1>Passing Values</h1>
<h2>Form submission</h2>

<p>We can pass values from the client to the server through the URL or 
    through the body of the request.</p>

<p>When you submit a form, you can use either the "POST" or "GET" method. 
    The "POST" method sends the form submission through the body of the request.
The "GET" method for a form submission sends the form submission values through the url.</p>

<p>I remember like this:</p>

<ul>
    <li>post</li>
    <li>body</li>
    . <br>
    . <br>
    <li>get</li>
    <li>url</li>
</ul>
